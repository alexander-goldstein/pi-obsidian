# Obsidian CLI

Use the `obsidian_cli` tool from the project extension when available.
If the tool is unavailable, fall back to shell command `obsidian ...`.

Requires Obsidian desktop app to be running.

## Command reference

Run `obsidian help` to see all available commands. This is always up to date.
Docs: https://help.obsidian.md/cli

## Syntax

Parameters use `=`:

```bash
obsidian create name="My Note" content="Hello world"
```

Flags are booleans with no value:

```bash
obsidian create name="My Note" overwrite
```

For multiline content, use `\n` and `\t`.

## File targeting

Many commands accept `file` or `path`. If omitted, active file is used.

- `file=<name>` resolves like wikilinks
- `path=<path>` is exact from vault root (`folder/note.md`)

## Vault targeting

Use `vault=<name>` first to target specific vault:

```bash
obsidian vault="My Vault" search query="test"
```

## Common patterns

```bash
obsidian read file="My Note"
obsidian create name="New Note" content="# Hello"
obsidian append file="My Note" content="New line"
obsidian search query="search term" limit=10
obsidian property:set name="status" value="done" file="My Note"
obsidian tasks todo
obsidian tags sort=count counts
obsidian backlinks file="My Note"
```

Use `total` on list commands for counts.

## Plugin development loop

After plugin/theme changes:

1. Reload plugin
   ```bash
   obsidian plugin:reload id=my-plugin
   ```
2. Check errors
   ```bash
   obsidian dev:errors
   ```
3. Verify UI
   ```bash
   obsidian dev:screenshot path=screenshot.png
   obsidian dev:dom selector=".workspace-leaf" text
   ```
4. Check console
   ```bash
   obsidian dev:console level=error
   ```

## Safety

Dangerous commands (`eval`, `dev:cdp`, `dev:debug`, `restart`) should only be run when explicitly requested by user.
